# Brain-Tumor-Detection-System
The project is focused on Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. 
Project Overview:
* Title: Brain Tumor Model Detection System
* Technologies Used:
  - Language: Python
  - Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms

Key Components:
1. Data Loading: The project utilizes Google Colab for file operations and data management. It mounts Google Drive to access necessary files.
2. Goal: The primary goal is to detect brain tumors using a machine learning or deep learning model, which likely involves image processing and classification.

Given the projectâ€™s mention of machine learning and deep learning, it's probable that it involves training models using brain scan images (like MRI) to classify or detect the presence of tumors.
